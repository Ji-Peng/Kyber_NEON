This is the source code for the paper "Efficient Implementation of Kyber on Mobile Devices".

Most of the code was developed by Lirui Zhao.

For Kyber's implementation on ARMv8-A, we recommend the paper "Neon NTT: Faster Dilithium, Kyber, and Saber on Cortex-A72 and Apple M1", which is faster than ours.
